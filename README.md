# Code for The Approximate Fisher Influence Function: Faster Estimation of Data Influence in Statistical Models

This folder contains the code used to generate the figures in "The Approximate Fisher Influence Function: Faster Estimation of Data Influence in Statistical Models" by Omri Lev and Ashia Wilson.

## Figure 1

To generate the plots in Figure 1: run Fairness_Unlearning_Experiments.pynb


## Figure 2

To generate the plots in Figure 2: run CV_Experiments.pynb

## Figure 3

To generate the plots in Figure 3: run Influence_Experiments.pynb


Note: This code is heavily based on the functions from the repository https://github.com/alstonlo/torch-influence
